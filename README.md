# COMP359-Assignment 3

Observe the change in diameter of a graph after visualizing its Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using either Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm. 

## Objective

Our objective is to develop a program that enables users to choose a graph from a pre-defined list generated by Nauty and select an algorithm (either Prim's or Kruskal's) to visualize the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the chosen graph. We aim to identify patterns in the change of diameter by testing the program on graphs of varying sizes and minimum/maximum degrees.
